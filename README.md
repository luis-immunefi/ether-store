# 🦾 EtherStore: The Most Secure Smart Contract Ever Written

Welcome to **EtherStore** — the Fort Knox of Solidity. This smart contract is so safe, so flawless, so *unhackable*, we didn’t even *need* to audit it.

## 🧠 Features

- Accepts your ETH. Gladly.
- Lets you withdraw your ETH. *Probably.*
- Public balance checker (because we’re transparent like that).
- Written in **raw, powerful, pure** Solidity. No frills. No frameworks. No fear.

## 🔐 Security

We’ve implemented the **most advanced, cutting-edge, military-grade** security protocols, including:

- ✅ Calling `.call()` with no gas stipend because we like to live on the edge.
- ✅ Updating balances *after* sending ETH — efficiency first!
- ✅ Absolutely no reentrancy guard. Because trust is faster than mutexes.
- ✅ No unit tests for edge cases — because there *are* no edge cases. We believe in the happy path.
